Calculate the torque values of a baby janky mobile for a school project.
I got lazy and made this quick so I didn't have to use my calculator.

This assumes the use of:
straight flat sticks for each level
object hanging from a string on the end of the stick (doesnt have to be on each end)
each level is suspended from a string slightly longer than those of the balancing objects
and some other stuff ill elaborate on sooner or later xd


I'm just posting this to keep it somewhere safe. I'll likely fix this project up to be actually useful to anyone but myself and not to look so hideious...
also I dont think it works for the last level of the mobile either xd.
